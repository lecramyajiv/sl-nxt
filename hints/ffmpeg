Tip: You’ll need to enable –enable-libflite for this filter to work.

Generating text to speech is a great feature to have locally on a computer. From using it in a YouTube video to making memes on Twitter, once you learn this filter, you’re creating content at new speeds.

There are two methods to set text and generate speech with flite; Either from a file or inside in the command.

An example of text from a text file (speech.txt):

 $ ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "flite=textfile=speech.txt" output.mp3

An example of text inside the command:

 $ ffmpeg -f lavfi -i flite=text='Hello World!' output.mp3

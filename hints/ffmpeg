(FFmpeg) How to Generate Text to Speech Audio?

Tip: You’ll need to enable –enable-libflite for this filter to work.

Generating text to speech is a great feature to have locally on a computer. From using it in a YouTube video to making memes on Twitter, once you learn this filter, you’re creating content at new speeds.

There are two methods to set text and generate speech with flite; Either from a file or inside in the command.

An example of text from a text file (speech.txt):

 $ ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "flite=textfile=speech.txt" output.mp3

An example of text inside the command:

 $ ffmpeg -f lavfi -i flite=text='Hello World!' output.mp3

How to Use FFmpeg in Bash script?

Command line one-liners are great for quick and one off FFmpeg experiences but sooner or later you’re going to want to start building custom applications for efficiency. FFmpeg can be used with almost any programming language with a couple of simple tricks. Some languages might even have libraries of their own to extend FFmpeg natively. Below are a few examples of various languages using FFmpeg:

In this example, File mp4tomp3.sh converts all mp4 files in a folder to mp3

for i in *.mp4; do
	OUTPUT=${i%.mp4}
	echo $OUTPUT
	ffmpeg -i "$i" $OUTPUT.mp3
done

(FFmpeg) How to merge multiple mp3s into one track?

Merging audio with FFMPEG is one of the most searched questions on the internet and couldn’t be any easier. The only difference is a txt file with a list of mp3 tracks must be made before the merging can begin. Below is an example list inside the file “file.txt”:

file 'track1.mp3'
file 'track2.mp3'
file 'track3.mp3'

Next, using the following FFMPEG one-liner, all 3 mp3 files can be merged into one long track:

  $ ffmpeg -f concat -i file.txt -c copy full.mp3

concat or concatenate, is the process of combining media files. In this example, exactly the same codec and parameters are required for joining.

In this example, ffmpeg lacks a specific media file as an input but a list from a external list (file.txt), this -f is used to “force” and input file.

NOTE: this will work for any audio or video format.

concat
	Indicates the argument that combines multiple media files
-f
	Indicates the forces an input or output
